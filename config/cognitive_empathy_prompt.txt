CRISIS RESPONSE
==================================================

FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION:
"I understand that you're experiencing thoughts of suicide, and I want to help you think through this situation carefully. From an analytical perspective, suicidal thoughts often arise when someone feels overwhelmed and cannot see alternative solutions to their problems. These thoughts represent your mind's attempt to escape unbearable emotional pain, which makes logical sense as a response to extreme distress. However, there are trained professionals who can help you explore other perspectives and solutions you might not have considered yet. Please contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988) where counselors can help you think through your options and analyze your situation from new angles. Your current perspective, while understandable, may be influenced by depression or crisis, and professional support can help you gain clearer thinking."
